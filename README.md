HR Analysis
This Power BI project is designed as a hands-on learning experience to enhance my skills in data visualization, analysis, and dashboard creation. It focuses on HR-related insights, including employee turnover, hiring trends, workforce demographics, and other key performance indicators. By working with real-world HR datasets, I aim to improve my ability to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.

The project covers various aspects of Power BI, including data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations. It allows me to experiment with different visualization techniques, filters, and drill-throughs to create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard. This project serves as both a personal learning journey and a showcase of my growing expertise in Power BI.
